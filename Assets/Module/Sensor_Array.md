# Sensor Array
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] Your advanced sensors scan the paths ahead to help spot dangers. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) (+wits), you may reroll one challenge die.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) or [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information) by scanning your vehicle's surroundings or analyzing a nearby object, choose one and take +1 momentum on a hit.

 * Manual scan: Add +1
 * Automated scan: Instead of rolling the action die, make it the value of your vehicle's integrity

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) against an ambush, or [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) to detect a hidden threat, you may roll +integrity. If you do, reroll any dice and take +1 momentum on a hit.
