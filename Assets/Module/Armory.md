# Armory
### Module


## Abilities:


- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/Combat/Enter_the_Fray) to oppose an invader within your vehicle, boost. On a strong hit, they were unprepared for your firepower. Add +1 to all moves until you roll a one on your action die.

- [ ] You may prepare for engaging in combat by taking limited-use armaments from your armory. If you do, one time only, when you [Enter the Fray](Moves/Combat/Enter_the_Fray), choose your approach.
     * Going in hot: On a hit, take +2 momentum. On a strong hit with a match, also mark progress.
     * Gain the upper hand: Add +2.

- [ ] You may prepare for a drawn-out battle by taking specialized ammunition. If you do, during a single combat scene only, you may reroll any action die showing a one when you [[Strike](Moves/Combat/Strike)](Moves/Combat/Strike) or [Clash](Moves/Combat/Clash).
