If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Withstand Damage](Moves/suffer/withstand_damage) and roll on the miss table, the overseer will do what it can to help. Roll twice on the table and choose either result.

- [ ] The overseer can pilot the vehicle independently. When you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) by handing over control to the AI in an emergency, or to summon the vehicle remotely within a hazardous situation, you may roll +integrity. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit.
