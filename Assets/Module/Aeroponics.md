### Module


## Abilities:


- [ ] You have a high yield aeroponics bay to enrich your food supply. When you [Resupply](Moves/Recover/Resupply) at a settlement in need of fresh food, add +1 or take +2 momentum on a hit. The food takes some time to regrow.

- [ ] You have cultivated part of the bay into a meditative arboretum. Once per journey when you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/Exploration/Undertake_an_Expedition), you may take time to recenter yourself and [Hearten](Moves/Recover/Hearten). If you do, add +2.

- [ ] You have an ideal growing environment for a specialized herb. Envision what this herb does. Then, when you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) by using this herb, add +2. Once pruned, this herb takes significant time to regrow.
