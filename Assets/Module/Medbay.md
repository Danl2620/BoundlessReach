# Medbay
### Module


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you use your medbay to [Heal](Moves/recover/heal) yourself or another patient, you may reroll your action die if its value is less than your vehicle's integrity.

- [ ] When you or an ally mark the permanently harmed impact and are brought to the medbay without delay (less than an hour or so), you have a shot at making things right. If you [Heal](Moves/recover/heal) and score a strong hit, clear the impact (in addition to the other benefits of the move). Then, envision the scar that now serves as a reminder of the incident.

- [ ] When you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) by performing a risky medical procedure, or if you [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information) through an autopsy or medical examination, reroll any dice and take +1 momentum on a hit.
