# Stabilizers
### Module


## Abilities:


- [ ] Your deflector array clears the way for safer passage. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/Exploration/Undertake_an_Expedition) through debris or asteroid fields, boost.

- [ ] Your inertial dampeners protect the ship&#x27;s vital systems. When you [Withstand Damage](Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage) from spaceborne environmental factors, add +2.

- [ ] Your gravity compensators create an isolating graviton field about your ship. When you [Face Danger](Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger) from gravitational forces around a star or stellar phenomenon, you may reroll any dice.
