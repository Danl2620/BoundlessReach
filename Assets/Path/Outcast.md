# Outcast
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [hearten](Moves/recover/hearten) in isolation, you may attempt to find solace in fond memories or a hopeful wish. If you do (decide before rolling), reroll any dice but count a strong hit as a weak hit.

- [ ] When you [Sacrifice Resources](Moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources) and your supply is reduced to 0, roll +wits. On a strong hit, you manage to scrape by and take +1 supply. On a weak hit, you may [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1) in exchange for +1 supply. On a miss, your supply remains at 0 and you [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1).

- [ ] When you or an ally [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn) and score a strong hit with a match, you may envision encountering someone who knows or understands you. If you [Make a Connection](Moves/connection/make_a_connection) with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.
