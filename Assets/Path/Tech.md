## Abilities:
- [ ] When you make a move to configure, optimize, hack, or disrupt an electronic system, add +1. On a weak hit, you can choose to press your luck. If you do, reroll all dice and add +2 (instead of +1).

- [ ] When you [Withstand Damage](Moves/suffer/withstand_damage) and score a miss, you may attempt to reroute power or reboot critical systems. If you do, first [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-2). Then, reroll all dice, add +wits instead of +integrity, and count a weak hit as a miss.

- [ ] When you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) or [Secure an Advantage](Moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by creating a computer program to perform a specific, complex function, add +2 and take +1 momentum on a hit. One time only, when you trigger the program to fulfill its purpose, reroll any dice.
