 * Charge: Roll +heart, and mark progress on a hit.
 * Evade: Roll +edge, and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] You wield an iconic blade. Give it a name. When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) by binding your promise to the blade, add +1. On a hit, fill the box below. If you make a move (including a progress move) using this oathbound blade and score a miss, you may clear the box to reroll any dice.
