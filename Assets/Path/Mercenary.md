# Mercenary
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you agree to wage war or defend others from war in exchange for payment or promises, you may [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to see the mission done. If you do, reroll any dice. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow), make the legacy reward one rank higher (1 extra box if already epic).

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Moves/connection/make_a_connection) by searching out or making contact with someone in need of your services, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, this mission pits you against an unresolved aspect of your past or a hated foe; mark 2 ticks on your quests legacy track.

- [ ] When you [Check Your Gear](Moves/adventure/check_your_gear) in the midst of a fight, or [Resupply](Moves/recover/resupply) by looting the field of battle in the aftermath of a fight, add +2.
