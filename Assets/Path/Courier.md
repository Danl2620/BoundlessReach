### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to transport and protect something precious, set its safety to 5. When you [Undertake an Expedition](Moves/exploration/undertake_an_expedition) or [Set a Course](Moves/exploration/set_a_course) and score a weak hit or miss, you may suffer -1 safety as the cost. On a miss with a match, you must suffer -2 safety as the cost. When safety falls to 0, envision a major complication related to this mission. If you overcome the threat, mark progress twice on this quest. Then, set safety to 3.

- [ ] When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) to an unbonded connection by completing a courier mission, mark progress twice on the relationship.

- [ ] When you [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn) during a courier mission, you may roll +safety. On a strong hit, take +1 safety or +1 momentum.
