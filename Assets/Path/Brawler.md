# Brawler
### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) by attempting to disarm, trip, shove, grapple, or stun your foe, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Clash](Moves/combat/clash) in close quarters, you may draw on your momentum to gain advantage. If you do, [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-2) and choose one (before rolling).

 * Aggressive: Count a weak hit as a strong hit.
 * Defensive: Count a miss as a weak hit.

- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) already positioned in close quarters against your foe, mark progress on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, your initial assault leaves them stunned; also take +2 momentum.
