## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Face Danger](Moves/adventure/face_danger) or [React Under Fire](Moves/combat/react_under_fire) by guiding your vehicle through a hazard or out of harm’s way, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

- [ ] When you [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) by maneuvering your vehicle against a foe, add +1. If you score a strong hit with a 4, 5, or 6 on the action die, you may put yourself in firing position. If you do, set aside the action die or note its value. If you or an ally [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) using the vehicle’s weapons, preset your action die with that value. This persists until you fail to score a strong hit on that move, or until you make another move which changes your vehicle’s position.

- [ ] When you must [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) while piloting a vehicle, you may roll +integrity. If you do, take +1 momentum on a strong hit.
