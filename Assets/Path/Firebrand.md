### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] You wield fiery energy. When you rest and meditate to gather this energy, roll +spirit. On a strong hit, take up to +3 fire. On a weak hit, take +2. On a miss, take +2 fire but [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) (-2). Your max fire is +5. When you make moves aided by this energy to attack or overcome obstacles, add +2 and suffer -1 fire.

- [ ] When you [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) and score a strong hit with a match, you may instead ignore the harm and take +fire equal to the amount of harm faced (+1, +2, or +3).

- [ ] When you have at least +3 fire, you may [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) or [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) by unleashing hell. If you do, take an automatic strong hit and mark progress. Then, set your fire to 0.
