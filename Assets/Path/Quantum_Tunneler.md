# Quantum Tunneler
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] When you [Face Danger](Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger) or [Secure an Advantage](Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) by quantum tunneling to a position nearby and within sight, add +2 but treat a weak hit as a miss. If through an obstacle to a nearby but unseen location, treat a weak hit as a miss but take +2 momentum on a strong hit.

- [ ] When you [Clash](Moves/Combat/Clash) and score a weak hit, you may forgo marking progress to be in control as you tunnel away. When you [Strike](Moves/Combat/Strike) and score a weak hit, you may mark progress only once (instead of twice) to be in control as you tunnel to reposition.

- [ ] When you attempt to quantum entangle yourself to a location, roll +heart or +wits. On a hit, you may quantum tunnel to that location from any distance, but it is dangerous. On a miss, as above but the entangling is harmful. [Endure Harm](Moves/Suffer/Endure_Harm) (-2). When you [Face Danger](Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger) to do so, treat a weak hit as a miss. Once used, the entanglement fades.
