## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) by facing off against your foe (+heart), or by preparing to act without tipping them off (+shadow), add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, you may immediately take a shot (without making a move) and mark progress twice.

- [ ] When you [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) or [React Under Fire](Moves/combat/react_under_fire) by moving into cover, add +1. On a strong hit, this cover gives you leverage; add +1 when you make a move to attack or defend at range. If you then score a miss, the cover is lost or compromised.

- [ ] When you [Compel](Moves/adventure/compel) or [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) with the threat of violence by holding someone at gunpoint, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
