## Abilities:
- [ ] You are a walking armory, with a weapon for every occasion. When you [Enter the Fray](Moves/combat/enter_the_fray) in personal combat, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit. Once per fight, when you [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) by switching weapons or changing tactics, take an automatic strong hit.

Then, [Sacrifice Resources](Moves/suffer/sacrifice_resources) (-1). If you score a strong hit on this attack and immediately [Take Decisive Action](Moves/combat/take_decisive_action), you may retain the value of one challenge die from your [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) action instead of rolling that die.
