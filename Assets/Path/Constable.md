# Constable
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] You are an agent of the law from a nearby locality. Envision where your authority comes from. When you invoke the law and [Compel](Moves/Adventure/Compel) a person familiar with the authority you are associated with, boost.

- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/Quest/Swear_an_Iron_Vow) (formidable or greater) to bring a lawbreaker to justice, reroll any dice. After you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/Quest/Fulfill_Your_Vow) and score a hit, if you [Make a Connection](Moves/Connection/Make_a_Connection) with a victim of the criminal, add +2.

- [ ] When you [Gather Information](Moves/Adventure/Gather_Information) while investigating a crime, you may roll a three dice challenge. On a miss with a match, envision what you learn of a deepening conspiracy or betrayal, make the rank of your quest one higher (no greater than epic), and use the new rank when marking future progress.
