# Precog
### Path


## Abilities:


- [ ] You can see brief moments into the future allowing you to attempt avoiding mistakes. When you score a miss on [Face Danger](Moves/Adventure/Face_Danger), [Clash](Moves/Combat/Clash) or [React Under Fire](Moves/Combat/React_Under_Fire), you may choose for this to have been a vision of an avoidable future. If you do, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2), envision how you approach the situation differently and reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +1 momentum.

- [ ] As above, but it can be used when you score a miss on [Enter the Fray](Moves/Combat/Enter_the_Fray), [Strike](Moves/Combat/Strike) or [Gain Ground](Moves/Combat/Gain_Ground).

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/Adventure/Secure_an_Advantage) with your precognitive ability, [Lose Momentum](Moves/Suffer/Lose_Momentum) (-2) and make the hit options add +2 and take +1 momentum instead of the normal options.
