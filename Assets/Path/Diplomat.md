### Path


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you [Swear an Iron Vow](Moves/quest/swear_an_iron_vow) to resolve a dispute, negotiate an agreement, or gather support, add +1. On a strong hit, mark progress on the quest. When you [Fulfill Your Vow](Moves/quest/fulfill_your_vow) on a diplomatic mission (formidable or greater) and score a hit, also mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.

- [ ] When you make a move to defuse, reason, or negotiate, add +1. On a miss, you may take a different tack. Envision this new approach, reroll all dice, and add +2. If you score a miss yet again, face a dire complication or blow to your reputation as you [Pay the Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price).

- [ ] When you [Make a Connection](Moves/connection/make_a_connection) or [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn), add +1. If you [Sojourn](Moves/recover/sojourn) and score a strong hit with a match, you are shown great kindness or respect; take +2 momentum or make an extra recover move with an automatic strong hit.
