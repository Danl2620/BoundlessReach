# Revenant
### Deed


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you are at 0 health, and [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) or [Face Death](Moves/threshold/face_death), add +1. You may then reroll your action die if its value is less than your spirit.

- [ ] When you [Take Decisive Action](Moves/combat/take_decisive_action) by bringing death to a foe, you may burn momentum to zero out one (not both) of the challenge dice if your momentum is greater than the value of that die. If you do, [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) (-2).

- [ ] When you [Gather Information](Moves/adventure/gather_information) by studying a place where death left its mark, you may roll +heart. If you do, take +1 momentum on a hit. On a strong hit with a match, you experience a detailed vision or insightful revelation of what occurred here; take +1 momentum more.
