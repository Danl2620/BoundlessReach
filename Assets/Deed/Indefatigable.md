# Indefatigable
### Deed


## Abilities:
Once you have cleared indebtedâ€¦

- [ ] When you use your status as a rough and tough survivor to [Compel](Moves/Adventure/Compel) people who know of your previous ship&#x27;s destruction, boost.

- [ ] When you [Sojourn](Moves/Recover/Sojourn) and score a hit, you may regale the local community with the story of how you lost your previous ship. If you do, choose one:
     * Revel in your tenacity: Take +2 momentum.
     * Leverage your status: [Gather Information](Moves/Adventure/Gather_Information) +heart (instead of +wits).

- [ ] When you [Withstand Damage](Moves/Suffer/Withstand_Damage), roll with advantage. Then, if you score a strong hit and choose to ride it out, take +2 momentum (instead of +1).
