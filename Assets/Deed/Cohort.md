- [ ] You gain a specialist. The specialist is part of your crew, but is managed as a connection and provides benefits to you and your allies per their role. When you [Withstand Damage](Moves/suffer/withstand_damage) and score a miss, or if you [Pay_the_Price](Moves/fate/pay_the_price), you may suffer the cost by noting the specialist as out of action. An out of action specialist provides no benefit. To restore a specialist to duty, resolve the situation as appropriate to the nature of the injury, trauma, or dispute.

- [ ] You may gain additional specialists by spending 1 experience to add a connection to your crew as a specialist. Specialist bonuses may not be stacked for a single action.

- [ ] When you [Secure an Advantage](Moves/adventure/secure_an_advantage) by gathering your specialists to strategize or problem-solve, you may reroll one die for each participating specialist.
