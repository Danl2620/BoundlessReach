# Survivor
### Deed


## Abilities:
- [ ] When you are haunted by past experiences and must [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress), you may [Lose Momentum](Moves/suffer/lose_momentum) (-1) before rolling as you attempt to find focus or calm. If you do, reroll any dice. On a strong hit, take +1 momentum.

- [ ] When you make a move where a lasting effect (traumatized or permanently harmed) has a narrative impact on the scene or your approach, and burn momentum to improve your result, you may envision what sustains or motivates you in this moment. If you do, mark 1 tick on your quests or bonds legacy track. On a strong hit with a match, mark 2 ticks.

- [ ] You are learning to live with this impact. The lasting effect (traumatized or permanently harmed, but not both) remains marked, but no longer reduces your max momentum or reset.
