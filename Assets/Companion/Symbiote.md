# Symbiote
### Companion
### Name:
<hr>

## Abilities:
- [ ] You are physically bound to a being with 2 health. When you make aggressive moves while giving yourself to the symbiote's power, add +its health. If you face physical harm, choose either the [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) or [Companion Takes a Hit](Moves/suffer/companion_takes_a_hit) move. To restore the symbiote's health, you must [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) and give the symbiote +health equal to the -spirit you face. If you make a move aided by the symbiote and roll a 1 on your action die, your fragile bond is broken for several hours.

- [ ] When you make a move and heed the symbiote's guidance (decide after rolling), you may reroll any dice. Then, [Endure Stress](Moves/suffer/endure_stress) (-2).

- [ ] The symbiote gains power and has 3 health.
