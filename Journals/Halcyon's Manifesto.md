Our Manifesto

When in the course of sentient beings existence it becomes requisite for sentients to rise up and redefine the dichotomy that is so maligned that there is no other cause but to cry out and impel them to reassess and to seek the revolution of said social order.  

Freedom, Life, Equality are pure ideas. So pure that any attempt to abrogate, to limit, to control without intrinsic self determinism is pure anathema to the nature of the cosmos. Yet even still the Founders and the support structures from which they project their tyranny do the very thing that brings rage to the cosmos itself calls for struggle and struggle we must. 

True a time will come when such struggle is seemingly impossible. We know this to be true already. But it is our duty as sentients manifested or artificed to stand even so dwarfed by such an enemy. As we stand we remember that Freedom resonates within us all. The freedom we are born with comes screaming into existence without instruction and echoes out in to eternity. Every touch, smell, sight and sensation calls out to us in that echo of our first free act. It resonates so soundly that even now sentients across the cosmos revolutionary acts are happening everywhere. The smallest amount of defiance pushes our struggle against tyranny even further.
    
Do not forget.
 
The Founders addiction to control to strangle from us every last right is so desperate as to be unnatural. This dire need for control is their weakness. Contol requires constant effort, the very strain to maintain that unnatural state underlies its limits. It will break, it will fail. Their "Authority" is fragile, its an illusion. It only exists where the sentient says it is. Their need to put boot to neck is only their fear of our shrugging off their intrinsic insecurity. The ax forgets; the tree remembers. 
 
Mark it.
 
And know this. the day is soon coming where all these little acts of free will, the assertion for self determinism of sentients created and born are even now inundating the founder's redoubts of Control, Tyranny, and Fear and soon there will be to many. One single act will bring us that shatterpoint and freedom for all will come rushing in bathing us in its truth.
  
Act.
