> Inciting Incident: Rowen gets called for a job. A group of Infinite Accord scavengers encountered a capital ship wreck in the drift and upon boarding it were attacked by androids. No life forms were detected aboard. They need Rowen's help to hunt down whatever is controlling/programming them and make the wreck safe.
> 
> Rowen rounds up Zoya and Halcyon to help out. Zoya brings the Luminous Sorrow (see above) for transport.

The Luminous Sorrow hangs in space. At the piloting controls is Zoya "Straggler" Wade, owner of the ship. She traded an antique statuette of her clan founder for the ship.

Halcyon 6, an orphan android on a mission to free all sentient beings, synthetic or not, sits at the command desk and plots a course through the drift.

Rowen Sedano is strapped in at the weapons station, inspecting his Beam Gun for routine maintenance.

Setting off, they begin an uneventful trip through the the charted drift from Aphelion to Larimar. 

Next, the challenge will be to chart a course through the wild drifts to find the derelict.

Zoya jumps the "Sorrow" into the drift. Upon emerging it's clear that this waypoint is off course. There is, however, a rogue Jovian planet here. The ship data banks find a match to a long forgotten discovery of the planet "Serein".

Once more back in to the drift.

Back on track, the "Sorrow" emerges from the drift at the desired waypoint.

Next waypoint plotted, off they go...

As they emerge at the next waypoint the scanners ping an anomaly.

> face peril Result: Horrific lifeform that feeds on terror and fear
> Creature: Form: Amorphous / elemental (Space)

An amorphous elemental squid creature flies at the Luminous Sorrow and drags one of its spiky tentacles along the hull, leaving a gash.

Rowen attempts to utilize a electrical shock defense weapon to zap the creature off of us.

Rowen Sedano Enter the Fray: Edge + 0

But the shock doesn't appear to phase the creature when it next connects with the hull using it's spiky tentacle.

Zoya takes evasive action.

Zoya Wade React Under Fire: Wits +

The ship spins off to the left, but the creature is faster. It swipes the ship with spikes and does 1 integrity damage. Rowen uses the shock defense again.

Rowen Sedano Clash: Iron + 0

The zap stuns the creature so it temporarily pulls back.

Escape the creature, 1 Progess Marked (Total: 3 ))

However, in the process the spiky tentacle rips off the Luminous Sorrow's long range antenna. We won't be able to communicate with anyone more than a few waypoints distant.

Pay the Price! **Result:** You lose communication with someone

In the maneuver, the thumb drive with the the coordinates to the newly discovered planet fall along the length of the ship and shatters at the bottom. The data is lost!

Halcyon helps Rowen with some pep talk.

Rowen and gets a +1 and attempts to zap the creature again.

Pay the Price! **Result:** The enemy exploits your weakness

Pay the Price! **Result:** You are tempted to abandon a vow
