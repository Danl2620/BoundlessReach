> Inciting Incident: Rowen gets called for a job. A group of Infinite Accord scavengers encountered a capital ship wreck in the drift and upon boarding it were attacked by androids. No life forms were detected aboard. They need Rowen's help to hunt down whatever is controlling/programming them and make the wreck safe.
> 
> Rowen rounds up Zoya and Halcyon to help out. Zoya brings the Luminous Sorrow (see above) for transport.

The Luminous Sorrow hangs in space. At the piloting controls is Zoya "Straggler" Wade, owner of the ship. She traded an antique statuette of her clan founder for the ship.

Halcyon 6, an orphan android on a mission to free all sentient beings, synthetic or not, sits at the command desk and plots a course through the drift.

Rowen Sedano is strapped in at the weapons station, inspecting his Beam Gun for routine maintenance.

Setting off, they begin an uneventful trip through the the charted drift from Aphelion to Larimar. 

Next, the challenge will be to chart a course through the wild drifts to find the derelict.

Zoya jumps the "Sorrow" into the drift. Upon emerging it's clear that this waypoint is off course. There is, however, a rogue Jovian planet here. The ship data banks find a match to a long forgotten discovery of the planet "Serein".

Once more back in to the drift.

Back on track, the "Sorrow" emerges from the drift at the desired waypoint.

As they emerge the scanners ping an anomaly. An amorphous elemental squid creature flies at the Luminous Sorrow and drags one of its spiky tentacles along the hull, leaving a gash.

Rowen, scrambling at the weapons statoins, attempts to utilize a electrical shock point defense weapon to zap the creature. The shock doesn't appear to phase the creature. It connects with the hull again using it's spiky tentacle.

Zoya at the controls takes evasive action. The ship spins off to the left, but the creature is faster. It swipes the ship with spikes and leaves another gash in the hull. 

Rowen uses the shock defense again and stuns the creature so it temporarily pulls back. However, in the process the spiky tentacle rips off the Luminous Sorrow's long range antenna. We won't be able to communicate with anyone more than a few waypoints distant.

"Rowen, you got this guy, zap him!", says Halcyon as Rowen lines up another point zap with the creature reaching out to the "Sorrow". There's an audible sizzling noise and the operating lights dim imperceptibly as the point defense shocks the squid's tentacle. It pulls back.

Zoya spins the ship around and applies full throttle to escape the creatures grasp, but the evasive maneuvering has led us right in to an undetected asteroid field. In the maneuver, the data disc with the location of "Serein" fall along the length of the ship and shatters at the far end.

Halcyon at the navigation controls quickly scans the field and points out a possible route through that could split us from the creature. Following the new course, Zoya pilots the ship through the asteroids and away from the creature.

Just as Zoya begins spinning up the Eidolon drive to jump, the creature zips through the asteroids and appears right next to us.

"Rowen it's reaching out again, I'll send over hull location!", Halcyon shouts.

Rowen pulls the trigger but the creature seems to anticipate the point defense and grabs another spot and spikes the hull.

Zoya spins the ship away and guns it but the amorphous creature is supernaturally fast. It zips along and grabs on to our ship, attaching itself. Zoya spins and flips the ship end from end but the creature has a firm grip. The point defenses have overheated so Rowen must wait a moment to use them again.

Zoya, seeing the creature has stopped attacking the ship, decides to jump to the drift. _Maybe the creature won't survive in the drift_, she thinks to herself.

Arriving at the next waypoint, Halcyon notices a life support alert flashing on the operations panel. There's a foreign gas being introduced into the oxygen recycler. He jumps out of his webbing and investigates -- the creature has pierced a stretch of life support plumbing and injected something. Halcyon moves quickly  to patch the system.

With the patch holding, he recycles the scrubbers and purges the toxin from the atmosphere.

At that point Halcyon notice a flicker of psionic chatter from the creature. _Can I talk to this thing?_, he thinks. _Seems like it..._ Halcyon engages the creature in psionic conversation. It becomes apparent that the creature is confused and thinks the "Sorrow" is a space whale full of tasty space whale blubber. Halcyon informs the creature of it's unfortunate misconception. The creature slinks away into the void of space.

Zoya jumps the "Sorrow" back in to the drift. We emerge in a waypoint off course.

"What the fuck, this is some bullshit. We barely survive that supernaturally fast squid thing only to wind up in uncharted space", Rowen exclaims as he unhooks himself from the webbing and floats off aftwards. "FUCK!!!"

Halcyon unhooks himself and heads back towards Rowen. "I got this", he says.

Halcyon huddles with Rowen. After a minute Rowen nods vigorously and returns to his station. "Sorry, Zoya. This mission isn't what I expected but I think we're getting close and I'm ready for the next step."

Zoya jumps the ship in to the drift. The "Luminous Sorrow" emerges at a star system. Before they can initiate a scan Halcyon notices a bio contamination warning referring to the "Sorrow"'s freshwater supply.

Our last supply stop gave us some contaminated water. Now we need to repair/upgrade our water filtration system.
