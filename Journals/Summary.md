### The Luminous Sorrow

The "Luminous Sorrow" hangs in space. At the piloting controls is Zoya "Straggler" Wade, owner of the ship. She traded an antique statuette of her clan founder for the ship.

Halcyon 6, an orphan android on a mission to free all sentient beings, synthetic or not, sits at the command desk and plots a course through the drift.

Rowen Sedano is strapped in at the weapons station, inspecting his Beam Gun for routine maintenance.

Setting off, they begin an uneventful trip through the the charted drift from Aphelion to Larimar. 

Next, the challenge will be to chart a course through the wild drifts to find the derelict.

Zoya jumps the "Sorrow" into the drift. Upon emerging it's clear that this waypoint is off course. There is, however, a rogue Jovian planet here. The ship data banks find a match to a long forgotten discovery of the planet "Serein".

Once more back in to the drift.

Back on track, the "Sorrow" emerges from the drift at the desired waypoint.

As they emerge the scanners ping an anomaly. An amorphous elemental squid creature flies at the Luminous Sorrow and drags one of its spiky tentacles along the hull, leaving a gash.

Rowen, scrambling at the weapons statoins, attempts to utilize a electrical shock point defense weapon to zap the creature. The shock doesn't appear to phase the creature. It connects with the hull again using it's spiky tentacle.

Zoya at the controls takes evasive action. The ship spins off to the left, but the creature is faster. It swipes the ship with spikes and leaves another gash in the hull. 

Rowen uses the shock defense again and stuns the creature so it temporarily pulls back. However, in the process the spiky tentacle rips off the Luminous Sorrow's long range antenna. We won't be able to communicate with anyone more than a few waypoints distant.

"Rowen, you got this guy, zap him!", says Halcyon as Rowen lines up another point zap with the creature reaching out to the "Sorrow". There's an audible sizzling noise and the operating lights dim imperceptibly as the point defense shocks the squid's tentacle. It pulls back.

Zoya spins the ship around and applies full throttle to escape the creatures grasp, but the evasive maneuvering has led us right in to an undetected asteroid field. In the maneuver, the data disc with the location of "Serein" fall along the length of the ship and shatters at the far end.

Halcyon at the navigation controls quickly scans the field and points out a possible route through that could split us from the creature. Following the new course, Zoya pilots the ship through the asteroids and away from the creature.

Just as Zoya begins spinning up the Eidolon drive to jump, the creature zips through the asteroids and appears right next to us.

"Rowen it's reaching out again, I'll send over hull location!", Halcyon shouts.

Rowen pulls the trigger but the creature seems to anticipate the point defense and grabs another spot and spikes the hull.

Zoya spins the ship away and guns it but the amorphous creature is supernaturally fast. It zips along and grabs on to our ship, attaching itself. Zoya spins and flips the ship end from end but the creature has a firm grip. The point defenses have overheated so Rowen must wait a moment to use them again.

Zoya, seeing the creature has stopped attacking the ship, decides to jump to the drift. _Maybe the creature won't survive in the drift_, she thinks to herself.

Arriving at the next waypoint, Halcyon notices a life support alert flashing on the operations panel. There's a foreign gas being introduced into the oxygen recycler. He jumps out of his webbing and investigates -- the creature has pierced a stretch of life support plumbing and injected something. Halcyon moves quickly  to patch the system.

With the patch holding, he recycles the scrubbers and purges the toxin from the atmosphere.

At that point Halcyon notice a flicker of psionic chatter from the creature. _Can I talk to this thing?_, he thinks. _Seems like it..._ Halcyon engages the creature in psionic conversation. It becomes apparent that the creature is confused and thinks the "Sorrow" is a space whale full of tasty space whale blubber. Halcyon informs the creature of it's unfortunate misconception. The creature slinks away into the void of space.

Zoya jumps the "Sorrow" back in to the drift. We emerge in a waypoint off course.

"What the fuck, this is some bullshit. We barely survive that supernaturally fast squid thing only to wind up in uncharted space", Rowen exclaims as he unhooks himself from the webbing and floats off aftwards. "FUCK!!!"

Halcyon unhooks himself and heads back towards Rowen. "I got this", he says.

Halcyon huddles with Rowen. After a minute Rowen nods vigorously and returns to his station. "Sorry, Zoya. This mission isn't what I expected but I think we're getting close and I'm ready for the next step."

Zoya jumps the ship in to the drift. The "Luminous Sorrow" emerges at a star system. Before they can initiate a scan Halcyon notices a bio contamination warning referring to the "Sorrow"'s freshwater supply.

Our last supply stop gave us some contaminated water. Now we need to repair/upgrade our water filtration system.

Upon scanning the system, the crew discovers a orbital colony, a large terraforming project, and a ship that matches a known signature: Boss "Clockstopper" Volo's ship.

Volo is a unsavory drift pirate that Halcyon has run across many times before. There's no indication that Volo has picked up on the "Sorrow" emerging from the drift.

Contacting the orbital colony, we discover it's named "Aeternitas". The "Sorrow" docks and we are able to flush our water systems when Halcyon successfully barters for a full load of water.

Entering the colony the crew visits a local tavern and they converse with the locals to find some information. They discover that Volo is a known entity here and the colony has a mildly positive disposition towards him for trader with them. They tell Zoya that they also know about the derelict and that Volo has traveled to it. They orbit an uninhabited planetoid.

Halcyon can't abide hearing anything positive said about Volo, so he chats with the locals further and regales them with stories of his encounters with Volo and many of Volo's exploits that are famous elsewhere in the Outlands.

In the tavern is on Arthir "Badger" Malek, a unkempt beast of a man who works as a loadmaster at the docks. Arthir is swayed by Halcyon's stories and tells the crew that he has information about Volo's ship and has seen it up close.

After some discussion with Arthir the crew refuels and sets out to meet up with the derelict (and Volo). Upon arriving they find both but are surprised to see a cloud of nanites emerge from the derelict and attack Volo's ship.

The crew suits up and Halcyon and Zoya navigate the 3 across the gap to enter an airlock on the derelict. Emerging from the airlock they find a barricaded corridor and Kasra "Nails" Kade, who reveals himself to be a disenchanted member of Volo's crew. Kasra doesn't want to impede the crew but also has no interest in joining them. He wanders on.

The crew moves on. A plasma fire arcs out of a wall, threatening to burn them. Halcyon dodges at the last minute.

The crew enters the ship's main hangar. There's a control terminal with a helpful AI and not much else here. Halcyon accesses the terminal and discovers that the ships core has been restarted and rigged to melt down.

The crew sets off to find the core. Along the way they come across yet another of Volo's crew, Ethin "Frostbite" Nealson. Ethin, however, is not coherent and Zoya notices he has the telltale sign of nanite intrusion on his temples.  Talking to "Frostbite" Zoya finds out he's getting attacked by nanites and is losing his grip on reality.

"What is Volo's status here?". No response. 

"What can you tell us about the rogue AI?" Zoya demans.

"It's gonna burn this hulk down" Ethin mumbles.

A corrosive leak shoots out and _almost_ his Halcyon but with his steely nerves he dodges it.

"What the hell? I think he's talking about the core meltdown, we have to hurry" Zoya says.

The crew reaches the core and sees that it's surrounded by strange jerry-rigged equipment and is glowing a frightening color. Rowen moves in to action to try and dismantled some of the surrounded equipment. Halcyon looks intently and guides him.

Suddenly over the crew comms they hear "Who are you? Stop interfering with my work" in a neutral voice.

Halcyon motions to Zoya and Rowen to stay quiet. 

-- Halcyon sweet talks the AI and convinces the AI to space Volo and his crew and join with Halcyon.

The AI informs us that it was considering doing something like that to Volo but that, for one, the ship is already in vacuum, and for two, the AI considers Volo to be an innocent nuisance.

Thanks to Halcyon's intervention, however, the AI will power down the core and avoid a meltdown.

### Larimar

Rowen sits down at the table already occupied by Arnav "Bluewing" Hunter at the seaside cafe.

"Find the carved wooden bird -- the Galaxy Bird -- from the bridge and you can keep as much salvage as you can carry." says Arnav. "Note there's a rogue AI on board that's been causing troubles. That's why we want you, monster hunter."

### The Derelict

With the core shutdown the derelict reverts to emergency lighting only. Much of the lighting has burned out or is intermittent. The ship is dark with flickering emergency lights along the corridors. The crew must use headlamps to navigate.

The AI tell Halcyon that it's only "gone rogue" to survive. Scavengers boarded long ago and shattered some xenomorph containment vessels. AI had to take over to protect itself.

The colonizers collected the large insectoid creatures from the large planet in the same system before wiping them out to begin their terraforming project.

With access to the ship AI, Halcyon determines that Volo is heavily armed and barricaded on the bridge. 

"Knowing him, he's probably called for some backup", says Halcyon.

The crew sets off for the bridge. Rowen and Rocky (the "Rockhorn") lead the way. As the turn a corner in a corridor an automated laser defense fires, hitting one of the oxygen hoses on Rocky's environmental suit.

Using the ship scanners, Halcyon lets the crew know that Volo is barricaded on the bridge with 3 of his crew, 2 of whom are already wounded.

He also discovered that there is a large locked vault aft of the bridge where the bird artifact is likely stored.

The 3 set up to attack the bridge in force. Rowen suggests that his sword, gun, and Rockhorn combo is probably the right force level to do the job. 

The bridge has two entrances. Rowen readies his attack at one while Zoya posts up at the second.

Rowen blasts the door open and has Rocky run inside. Volo is caught off guard and his crew isn't much better prepared. In two smooth motions Rowen slashes one guard and shoots Volo in the shoulder. Volo falls to the ground and the remaining two guards throw up their hands.

Arthir notifies Halcyon over comms that a Keeper has arrive in the system. Zoya lets the other two know that the Keeper will be bad news for her (and the "Sorrow").
