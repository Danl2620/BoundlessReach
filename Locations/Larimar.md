Larimar is a water world with enormous tides. People settled here a hundred years ago by building giant artificial islands anchored to the ocean floor that ride the tides.

The primary industries of Larimar are salvage of the ancient ruins lying on the seabed along with fishing exotic sea life in the complex reef systems.

Ramshackle is managed by the "Infinite Accord" faction. It's the gateway settlement for Larimar and trades in exotic fish, other seaborne lifeforms, and ancient tech and materials mined from the ocean floor of Larimar.

The name comes from the way the original settlement's artificial islands were linked together and rode the tides in a "ramshackle" way.
